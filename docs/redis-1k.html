						<p>This article describes my approach to write a Redis clone in C#,
limiting myself to 1024 lines of code (as stated by the code analysis
tool <a href="https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc">cloc</a>).</p>
<h2 id="the-goal">The goal</h2>
<p>Allow the official redis CLI tool to connect to our server and
perform as many operations as standard conform as possible. As an
experiment, I will use</p>
<h2 id="the-beginning">The beginning</h2>
<p>Of course, I could start by looking at the protocol specification and
start implementing the server based on the this, but this would be a bit
boring. Instead, let’s fire up a plain TCP server which listens on port
6379 (redis’ standard port) and check what the client sends us:</p>
<p>After setting up a project with
<code>dotnet new console -o src</code>, let’s spawn up a simple TCP
server which simply output what it has received</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode c#"><code class="sourceCode cs"></code></pre></div>
<p>and start <code>redis-cli</code> using the default docker image:</p>
<pre><code></code></pre>
<p>The output of the TCP server shows what data has been received.
Coming back to the specification, the client seemingly sends an array
with two elements. Each element is a bulk string.</p>
