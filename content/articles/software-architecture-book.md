# Overview

This page contains my notes, thoughts and remarks of the
book [Fundamentals of Software Architecture: An Engineering Approach. A Comprehensive Guide to Patterns, Characteristics, and Best Practices](https://www.amazon.de/Fundamentals-Software-Architecture-Comprehensive-Characteristics/dp/1492043451/ref=sr_1_1)
. I've taken these notes as part of [Scalable Capitals](https://scalable.capital) weekly reading group where we read
technical books and discuss chapters on a weekly basis.

## (1) Introduction

TODO

## (2) Architectural Thinking

Four main aspects of thinking like an architect:

1. Understand the difference between architecture and design
2. Have a wide breadth of technical knowledge and a certain level of technical depth
3. Understand, analyze and reconcile trade-offs
4. Understand the importance of business drivers

### Architecture Versus Design

Responsiblities of architect and development team

|Architect|Development Team|
|---------|----------------|
|Analyze business requirements| Create class diagrams for component|
|Select architectural patterns| Create user interface|
|Creating components|Develop and test|

This is challenging, if architecture is independent of design ("unidirectional design flow"). Instead, architect and development team **must be on the same virtual team** to facilitate bidirectional communication.

### Technical Breadth

### Analyzing Trade-Offs

### Understanding Business Drivers

### Balancing architecture and coding
