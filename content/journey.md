title: My Journey
---

I’ve let my younger self down. 

I started coding on a C64 and achieved a lot in the last thirty years — leading teams, designing systems, solving tough bugs, and earning promotions.

But I felt empty.

Even though my CV looked impressive, I didn't feel connected to what I loved - getting my hands dirty and solving real business problems that make a difference for customers.


To bring back the spark and make my younger self proud again, I moved to freelancing.

I build impactful features — from understanding the goal, to architecture, implementation, and rollout.

The spark returned.

My younger self is proud again, though would have a lot to say about my lack of gaming skills.


I want my work to matter.

That’s why I focus on startups and small businesses.

They don’t need abstract consulting, they need to move fast.

They need someone who delivers immediate value.

That’s where I excel.


What’s in it for you?

I improve your architecture to handle 10x the data, build a time-critical feature to close a big deal, or fix a framework bug which blocks a critical security upgrade.

I don’t just offer advice.

I’m in the code with your team.

I build what helps you scale and succeed.


Yet, I’m not the right fit for every company.

Don’t reach out if you’re

- looking for consultants rather than doers.

- not ready for rapid, hands-on problem-solving.

- prefer slow processes over fast, effective execution.


Ready for someone who doesn’t just write code but crafts solutions that resonate with your mission ... and has a talent for confusing, but funny, metaphors?
