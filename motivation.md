... even when readership might appear limited. What drives the creation of articles, snippets, and explanations that I may not actively promote?

The act of writing serves as a mechanism for organizing thoughts into a coherent structure, constructing persuasive arguments, and examining pros and cons. It also provides an avenue to simplify complex concepts for my own benefit. The ability to articulate a topic clearly implies a comprehensive understanding, echoing the words of [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman):

> If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it.

By publicly addressing subjects through writing, I'm compelled to delve deeply into my own thoughts, anticipate potential inquiries from readers, and verify if I've adequately addressed them.
