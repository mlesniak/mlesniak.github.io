# Hello, world!

This website is my [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden), a place to collect thoughts, drafts of articles and occasionally even finished articles about different topics I'm pondering about. 

The whole page is based on [harterrt's comment on Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27175826) (see also [Why Write?]({{< ref "why-write" >}}))

> Writing is useful even if nobody reads it. Writing clarifies and sharpens my thinking. I have ideas I wouldn't otherwise have.
