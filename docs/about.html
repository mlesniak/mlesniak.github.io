				<h1 class="title">About me</h1>
						<p>I’ve got a ton of experience as a software architect and engineer,
specializing in designing and crafting software systems that can handle
anything you throw at them. I’m your go-to person for languages like C#,
Kotlin, Java, and Go – I’ve wrapped up successful projects across a
bunch of industries. I’m all about creating software setups that can
take on the challenges of distributed systems and still keep ticking.
Complex problems? They’re my jam. I thrive when things get tough, and
I’ve got the track record to prove it.</p>
<p>But hey, it’s not all about work. My life outside the tech realm is a
colorful mix. I’m all about hitting the trails, soaking in the beauty of
the outdoors and taking on the challenges nature throws my way. You’ll
usually find me hiking, and I’m old-school – no electronic gadgets
tagging along. I’m also big on Yoga, finding my zen while balancing
life’s craziness. Oh, and Suki – she’s my four-legged bundle of joy, a
rescue dog who’s the absolute best.</p>
<p>When I’m not busy with all that, I’m nose-deep in books. Software
engineering and sci-fi are my favorite topics, especially the stuff
that’s won the Hugo award. And of course, I’m a perpetual tinkerer.
There’s always some interesting pet project I’m diving into.</p>
