## Why write articles? 

... which are probably not read by anyone.  What is the motivation for writing articles, snippets and explanations which I don't even actively advertise? 

The act of writing is the act of linearizing thoughts, to create structure in arguments, and discuss advantages and disadvantages. It also allows me to explain complex topics to my current self. If I can write clearly about a topic I assume I've also understood it. To quote [Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman)

> If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it.

By writing about topics publicly I'm also motivated to deeply think about what I've written and reflect on questions a potential reader might have and check if I have already answered them.
