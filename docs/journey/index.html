I started coding on a C64 and achieved a lot in the last thirty years — leading teams, designing systems, solving tough bugs, and earning promotions.

    <p>I’ve let my younger self down.</p>
<p>I started coding on a C64 and achieved a lot in the last thirty years — leading teams, designing systems, solving tough bugs, and earning promotions.</p>
<p>But I felt empty.</p>
<p>Even though my CV looked impressive, I didn&rsquo;t feel connected to what I loved - getting my hands dirty and solving real business problems that make a difference for customers.</p>
<p>To bring back the spark and make my younger self proud again, I moved to freelancing.</p>
<p>I build impactful features — from understanding the goal, to architecture, implementation, and rollout.</p>
<p>The spark returned.</p>
<p>My younger self is proud again, though would have a lot to say about my lack of gaming skills.</p>
<p>I want my work to matter.</p>
<p>That’s why I focus on startups and small businesses.</p>
<p>They don’t need abstract consulting, they need to move fast.</p>
<p>They need someone who delivers immediate value.</p>
<p>That’s where I excel.</p>
<p>What’s in it for you?</p>
<p>I improve your architecture to handle 10x the data, build a time-critical feature to close a big deal, or fix a framework bug which blocks a critical security upgrade.</p>
<p>I don’t just offer advice.</p>
<p>I’m in the code with your team.</p>
<p>I build what helps you scale and succeed.</p>
<p>Yet, I’m not the right fit for every company.</p>
<p>Don’t reach out if you’re</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>looking for consultants rather than doers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not ready for rapid, hands-on problem-solving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>prefer slow processes over fast, effective execution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready for someone who doesn’t just write code but crafts solutions that resonate with your mission &hellip; and has a talent for confusing, but funny, metaphors?</p>
<p>Shoot me a <a href="mailto:mail@mlesniak.com">message</a>. I’ll respond in &lt;10ms.</p>
