# Why is everything so slow?

## Motivation
- Why do I have to wait at all when applications start?
- Probably due to all the layers upon layers...
- Perform some experiments how fast we can get a naive file scanning app in Java

## Basic code

## Measurements

## Potential Improvements

## Questions

- Is it worth it? Writing stuff in non VM based languages? What about things like WASM?

## Resources

- GitHub repository containing all examples
