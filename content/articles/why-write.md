# Why write articles? 

... which are probably not read by anyone.  What is the motivation for writing articles, snippets and explanations which I don't actively advertise? 

The act of writing is the act of linearizing my thoughts, to create structure in my arguments, value advantages and disadvantages, and basically to explain complex topics to my former self. If I can write clearly about a topic I assume I've also understood it. To quote [Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman)

> If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it.

By writing about topics publicly I'm also motivated to deeply think about what I've written, relect on questions a potential read might have and decide if I have already answered them.
